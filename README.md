## BMI Calculator:
- This is a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
- The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
- The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

## Life in Weeks:
- This a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old. 
- It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

> You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. 

- Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
